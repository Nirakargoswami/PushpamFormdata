                NIRAKARGIRI NARENDRAGIRI GOSVAMI believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and
                has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
            </div>
            <p>
                • Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order.
                However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
                vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
            </p>
            <p>
                • NIRAKARGIRI NARENDRAGIRI GOSVAMI does not accept cancellation requests for perishable
                items like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes
                that the quality of product delivered is not good
            </p>
            <p>
                In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to our Customer Service team.
                The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his
                own end. This should be reported within 7 Days days of receipt of the products. In case you feel that the
                product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of
                our customer service within 7 Days days of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team after
                looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision.
